1. In this folder run:  docker build -t xlora .
2. On terminal run: bash run_docker.sh
3. After executing the docker container, go to vscode right click the "><" on the left_bottom corner and click "attach to the running container" then select your running container.
    This will bring you to the vscode environment that is under the docker dependency.
4. Install Jupyter, Jupyterhub and Python extension in the container
5. Go to test.ipynb and click on the select kernel at right-upper corner. For the first time choose "Existing kernel" -> "Enter URL" -> Type: http://localhost:8888.
    If "Python (Docker)" kernel already exist then select that one
6. Enter the args for testing and the run every cell as colab to execute the code.
7. Set a break point you want to use by clicking the beginning part for the line of code you want to stop by.
8. To debug, you will need to select "Debug Cell" by dragging down the more options next to the execution button.
9. The debugger has several options:
    1 "Step next" is to go to next line of code and walk step by step and entering every functions following execution,
    2."Step over" is to skip the function that will require to switch to the other stack and just go line by line in current context
    3. "Continue" is to directly jump to the next breakpoints following the execution pipeline of the code. You can set the breakpoints on the fly!!
    4. You can open terminal and select the debugger console to type in the variable name and command like: a.shape or a + b to get the value of that.
